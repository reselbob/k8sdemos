# Deployment Discovery Under Kubernetes

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate how to have a service bind between alternate deployments

## Application Source Code

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const port = process.env.PORT|| 3000;
const color  = process.env.COLOR_ECHO_COLOR || "NO_COLOR";

const handleRequest = function(request, response) {
    const str = JSON.stringify({color, date: new Date()}, null, 4);
    response.writeHead(200);
    response.end(str);
    console.log(str);
};

const server = http.createServer(handleRequest);
server.listen(port, ()=>{
    console.log(`Listening on port ${port}, started at : ${new Date()}`);
});
```

## Lab Instructions

**Step 1:** Go to the `kubernetes` playground in Katacoda:

`https://katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes/playground`

**Step 2:** Clone this GitHub Repository

`git clone https://github.com/reselbob/innosoft.git`

Go the `manifests` directory of the project. The `manifests` directory contains all the `yaml` files
we'll need to set up Red and Green deployments as well as the Kubernetes service that will bind to each accordingly.

**Step 3:** To go the `manifests` directory execute the following command:

`cd innosoft/microservices-architecture/03-deployment-discovery-red-green/manifests`

## Set up the Red and Green Deployments

**Step 4:** Execute the following command to execute the Red deployment in your Kubernetes cluster

`kubectl apply -f red-deployment.yaml`

**Step 5:** Execute the following command to execute the Green deployment in your Kubernetes cluster

`kubectl apply -f green-deployment.yaml`

## Set up the Kubernetes service

**Step 6:** Take a look at the contents of the service manifest file, `service.yaml`.

`cat service.yaml`

You'll get results like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: echocolor
spec:
  selector:
    app: echocolor
    color: red
  ports:
  -
    protocol: TCP
    port: 3000
    targetPort: 3000
  type: NodePort
```

Notice that service is going to bind to pods that have the labels, `app: echocolor` and `color: red`. The pods that are declared in `red-deployment.yaml` have these labels. You can check by running, 

`cat red-deployment.yaml`

and you get output as follows:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: echocolor-red
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: echocolor
      color: red
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: echocolor
        color: red
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: echocolor-red
          image: reselbob/echocolor:v0.1
          ports:
            -
              containerPort: 3000
          env:
            - name: COLOR_ECHO_COLOR
              value: RED
```

**Step 7:** Execute the following command to execute the service in your Kubernetes cluster

`kubectl apply -f service.yaml`

## Confirm installation of Deployments and Service

**Step 8:** Execute the following command to confirm that the service is running under Kubernetes

`kubectl get services | grep echocolor`

**Step 9:** Execute the following command to confirm that the deployments are running under Kubernetes

`kubectl get pods | grep echocolor`


## Find the NodePort IP address

**Step 10:** To get the NodePort, execute the following command

`kubectl get services |grep NodePort`

You'll get out similar to:

`echocolor    NodePort    10.98.233.204   <none>        3000:32329/TCP   10s`

**WHERE** the NodePort in this instance is `32329`. The NodePort `<NODE_PORT>` in your running instance will differ.

**Step 11:** Get the master Node IP address

`kubectl cluster-info`

You'll get output similar to this:

```text
Kubernetes master is running at https://172.17.0.50:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://172.17.0.50:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
```

**WHERE** `172.17.0.50` is the IP address (`<MASTER_IP>`) of the Kubernetes cluster running in this instance. The NodePort in your running instance will differ.

**Step 12:** Call the service using `http`

`curl http://<MASTER_IP>:<NODE_PORT>`

You should see similar output as follows:

```json
{
    "color": "RED",
    "date": "2019-07-23T04:07:15.857Z"
}
```

**Step 13** Change the `service.yaml` manifest to look for pods that have the select, `color:green`.

This is the current version of `service.yaml`. Notice the entry, `color:red`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: echocolor
spec:
  selector:
    app: echocolor
    color: red
  ports:
  -
    protocol: TCP
    port: 3000
    targetPort: 3000
  type: NodePort

```

Open `service.yaml` in the `vi` editor like so:

`vi service.yaml`

Strike the key, `i` to put `vi` into insert mode.

And then make the change from `color: red` to `color:green` as shown below.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: echocolor
spec:
  selector:
    app: echocolor
    color: green
  ports:
  -
    protocol: TCP
    port: 3000
    targetPort: 3000
  type: NodePort

```

Strike the `esc` key to take `vi` out of edit mode.

Then strike the `:` key followed by `wq`.

Finally string the `enter` key to save the changes.

**Step 14** Now, reapply the manifest, `service.yaml` using the following command.

`kubectl apply -f service.yaml`

**Step 15** Run the `curl` command again:

`curl http://<MASTER_IP>:<NODE_PORT>`

You should see similar output as follows:

```json
{
    "color": "GREEN",
    "date": "2019-07-23T04:07:15.857Z"
}
```

**Challenge** : Create and deploy a `yellow` deployment and adjust the service `echocolor` to use
the `yellow` deployment. 

**Hint:** Notice that the manifests, [red-deployment.yaml](manifests/red-deployment.yaml) and 
[green-deployment.yaml](manifests/green-deployment.yaml) use the same
container image to provide the application behavior. Maybe there's a way to adapt the content in
the deployment manifests to create the new deployment that has the "yellow" behavior and bind it to the Kubernetes service
defined in the manifest file, [service.yaml](manifests/service.yaml).
